**NutilWeb**
==============

Nutil quantifies features per atlas-region based on the atlas files from WebAlign and the segmentation files from ilastik. It generates:

1. Reports with quantifications per atlas-region (counts and percentage coverage)
2. Plots showing percentage coverage per atlas-region
3. Images showing the features superimposed on the atlas maps
4. Coordinate files that may be viewed with Meshview

Fill in the form to analyse your data.

Segmentations
-------------

* Generate segmentations with the ilastik software. 
* Place these in a folder titled "seg_dir", zip the folder and upload the "seg_dir.zip" to the collab bucket.

.. note::
   The segmentations must comply with _sXXX naming convention.


Atlas files

* Register the section images to the reference atlas using WebAlign.
* Download the atlas files from WebAlign using the "Export overlays" button: this creates a zipped folder containing the relevant atlas files.
